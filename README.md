The `uart_128` module is designed to handle UART communication with 128-bit wide data. It integrates components for both UART transmission and reception, making it suitable for applications that require high-throughput serial communication. Here's a detailed description of what such a module might include:

### **Module Description**

#### **Inputs:**
- **`clk`**: Clock signal for synchronizing the UART operations.
- **`en_tx`**: Enable signal for UART transmission. When high, the module is enabled to transmit data.
- **`en_rx`**: Enable signal for UART reception. When high, the module is enabled to receive data.
- **`data_in[127:0]`**: 128-bit wide data input to be transmitted via UART.

#### **Outputs:**
- **`u_tx_done`**: Signal indicating the completion of the UART transmission process. It goes high when the 128-bit data has been fully transmitted.
- **`u_rx_done`**: Signal indicating the completion of the UART reception process. It goes high when the 128-bit data has been fully received.
- **`data_out[127:0]`**: 128-bit wide data output received via UART.

#### **Internal Wires/Signals:**
- **`uart_tx`**: Intermediate signal for transmitting data serially. Typically an 8-bit signal representing data to be transmitted over UART.
- **`uart_rx`**: Intermediate signal for receiving data serially, often used to carry the received serial data back into the UART module.

### **Functional Description**

1. **Transmission (`tx_uart` Module)**:
   - The `tx_uart` submodule takes the 128-bit `data_in` and breaks it down into smaller chunks suitable for serial transmission.
   - It handles the serial transmission of these chunks over the `uart_tx` line.
   - The `u_tx_done` signal is asserted once all 128 bits have been successfully transmitted.

2. **Reception (`rx_uart` Module)**:
   - The `rx_uart` submodule receives the serial data from the `uart_tx` line.
   - It reconstructs the received data into a 128-bit word.
   - The `u_rx_done` signal is asserted once the full 128-bit data has been successfully received and reconstructed.

### **Operation**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Upon initialization, the module waits for `en_tx` and `en_rx` to be asserted to start the respective processes.

2. **Data Transmission**:
   - When `en_tx` is high, the `tx_uart` submodule starts transmitting the 128-bit data in chunks (e.g., 8 bits at a time) over `uart_tx`.
   - The transmission is complete when `u_tx_done` is asserted.

3. **Data Reception**:
   - When `en_rx` is high, the `rx_uart` submodule starts receiving serial data on `uart_tx`.
   - It reconstructs the 128-bit data and asserts `u_rx_done` when the reception is complete.

### **Considerations**

- **Timing**: Ensure proper synchronization between the clock and UART signals to avoid timing issues.
- **Data Width**: Adapt the module to handle the 128-bit data width effectively, ensuring that `tx_uart` and `rx_uart` are correctly implemented to manage this width.
- **Error Handling**: Consider incorporating error handling mechanisms for cases where data transmission or reception might be incomplete or corrupted.

This module serves as a high-level wrapper for UART communication, making it suitable for applications that need to handle large data sizes efficiently in a serial communication environment.
